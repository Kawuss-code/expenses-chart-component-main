# Expenses chart component

## About me
Hi!
It's one of my first projects I hosted on GitHub.
I did many small projects in my school but they are usually focused on the mechanizm not on the good looking side so I won't post it here. They are usually written in JavaScript, Java, C++, C#, Python, PHP and some other projects using databases like MySQL, MSSQL and PostgreSQL.

## About project
I created it using only HTML, CSS and JS with prepared JSON file. Project is supposed to be responsive. I used JavaScript to take data from JSON file and make it correspond with CSS. You can change the data and see if it actually works. Bars should change and day with the most money spent should have blue bar.

## Tips & Questions
Because of using fetch I used LiveServer extension on VSC.
If you have any tips let me know I would love having feedback.
**Things that I would appreciate the most would be any advice on responsiveness**
